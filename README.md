# VHDL_samples

This is NOT a project but merely a collection of the exams for a course I took back in my bachelor programme.

Source codes may be either uncommented, or commented in Italian, or in a relatively broken English. I translated the original exam descriptions into English.

I'm only sharing the source code, not the procedure to set up a simulation but these solution were all tested and working properly.

I hope this may be useful to anyone who wants to learn VHDL.
